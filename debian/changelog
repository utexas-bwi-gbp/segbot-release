ros-hydro-segbot-sensors (0.1.8-0raring) raring; urgency=high

  * add missing segbot_sensors dependency on depthimage_to_laserscan
    (#20 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/segbot/issues/20>).
  * use ``roslaunch_add_files_check()`` to test that required launch
    file dependencies are declared.
  * fixed a few minor errors found on the real robot
  * added configuration with both the hokuyo and kinect in it
  * preparing to add kinect as well as the hokuyo for navigation
  * change nan to inf filter to handle max_range+ values as well. need to sort this all out in navigation
  * update change history
  * segbot_sensors: test any kinect launch files that do not us openni_launch (#20 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/segbot/issues/20>)
  * add roslaunch_add_file_check() unit test (#20 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/segbot/issues/20>, ros-drivers/openni_launch#10 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/openni_launch/issues/10>)
  * add missing segbot_sensors dependency on depthimage_to_laserscan (#20 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/segbot/issues/20>)
  * fixed issue with hydro costmap not accepting +inf range values

ros-hydro-segbot-sensors (0.1.7-0raring) raring; urgency=high

  * increased footprint where laser points are ignored. closes #19 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/segbot/issues/19>

ros-hydro-segbot-sensors (0.1.6-0raring) raring; urgency=high

  * removed nodelet manager reuse for depthimage_to_laserscan for the time being
  * fixed segbot_bringup to work with upcoming changes to freenect/openni launch files
  * assume no reading from kinect means clear. closes #17 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/segbot/issues/17>
  * fixed cmake function ordering
  * removed nan_to_inf filter from hokuyo config. closes #11 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/segbot/issues/11>

ros-hydro-segbot-sensors (0.1.5-0raring) raring; urgency=high

  * cleaned up and alphabetized cmake and package description files
  * nan_to_inf temporarily sets 0 values to inf as well. see #5 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/hokuyo_node/issues/5>

ros-hydro-segbot-sensors (0.1.4-0raring) raring; urgency=high

  * releasing 0.1.4 with properly formatted changelogs. see #10 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/segbot/issues/10>
  * some cmake cleanup

ros-hydro-segbot-sensors (0.1.3-0raring) raring; urgency=high

  * uncommented openni_launch as it has now been released into hydro. closes #9 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/segbot/issues/9>

ros-hydro-segbot-sensors (0.1.0-0raring) raring; urgency=high

  * fixed typo in filename
  * adding convenience vizualization launch file
  * now using only 50 pixels for depthimage_to_laserscan
  * added dependency on filters to use plugin export correctly
  * freenect_launch has been released into hydro, uncommenting run_depend in package.xml
  * finished catkinizing segbot_sensors #6 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/segbot/issues/6>
  * catkinizing against hydro. progress towards #6 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/segbot/issues/6>
  * added NanToInf to exported plugins list
  * fixed filters to split off footprint exclusion from processing nan values
  * converting nans from the sensor to positive infinite - feature used by new costmap_2d to assume no readings are empty
  * using entire height of kinect to generate laserscan. This does mean we get some points from the ground. need to improve filters to handle this
  * checking in configuration code not committed last time
  * chaning laser range to front 150 degrees
  * Revert "Test commit"
    This reverts commit 46c41cf9697ff40e67a750438d91d226fc34b3bd.
  * Test commit
  * Created launch file for USB cameras
  * footprint filter now handles min and max ranges correctly
  * added a new configuration for the Pharos IRISS group
  * updated manifest for sensors package
  * updated code to use depthimage_to_laserscan instead of pointcloud_to_laserscan
  * added a launch file, changed filter name to get rid of deprecation warning, added reading of tf prefix
  * bug fixes + now publishing the footprint polygon + appropriate configuration changes
  * added an untested laser filter plugin for removing laser returns on the segbot polygon footprint
  * fixed up h/w launch files, separating out common simulation elements
  * reogranized all the sensor launch files
  * a simple launch script to test naming and namespacing for the kinect
  * fixed a bug in kinect.launch, also added device_id as a parameter
  * some basic fixes to the hokuyo launch stuff - requires some testing on the actual hokuyo
  * changed the custom version of openni.launch to use kinect_frames from freenect_launch. This allows having a top level namespace in the kinect frames as well
  * fixed file permissions, also added a tf link from the base of the laser to the the laser itself
  * fixed a number of tf_prefix related issues
  * fixed parameter values for pointcloud_to_laserscan
  * fixed up the kinect based segway launch file (missing the device id for now)
  * added convenience launch script for the hokuyo
  * renamed launch file argument appropriately
  * directly accessing main freenect launch file (as I should have in the first place)
  * some untested launch files for the kinect
  * some launch file reorganization
  * added a separate package to hold launch files for sensors, mostly while kinect issues are sorted out
