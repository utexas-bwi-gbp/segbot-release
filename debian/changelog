ros-indigo-segbot-sensors (0.3.4-0saucy) saucy; urgency=high

  * unit test fixes (#65 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/segbot/issues/65>)
  * fix roslint errors
  * add missing dependency (#62 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/segbot/issues/62>)
  * modifications to the battery estimator to accomodate values greater
    than that of which the model was fitted from
  * updated the battery_diagnostics node to use a battery model if one
    exists on the segbot. If so, battery estimation times are added to
    diagnostics, otherwise its business as usual.
  * modified naming system for diagnostic messages. Added python
    dependencies required by the battery_profiler.py
  * segbot_v3: add robot monitor for diagnostics
  * added additional flexability to the battery_diagnostics sendmail
    node that will now allow parameters to be set in the launch file to
    reflect local segbot differences (different threshold levels,
    etc). Appropriate values have been added for the segbot_v3 in its
    launchfile. The segbot_v3 controller now republishes battery
    information onto the topic assumed by the battery diagnostics.
  * updated for hokuyo on segbot v3
  * changed filter in velodyne launch script.
  * added an outlier removal filter for the velodyne.
  * added statistical outlier filter.
  * switch from pointcloud to laserscan in navigation for the velodyne. Introduce the scan shadows filter.
  * added velodyne launch files for version 3

ros-indigo-segbot-sensors (0.3.0-0saucy) saucy; urgency=high

  * use different list of filters for segbot v1 and segbot v2 due to differences between different laser models.
  * added a launch file for ethernet hokuyo for segbot v2.

  * added some diagnostic publications.
  * removed hack in nan_to_inf filter that was setting values to max_range - epsilon.
